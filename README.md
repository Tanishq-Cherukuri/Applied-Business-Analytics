🍟 Enhancing Service Quality in Fast Food Restaurants Using Sentiment Analysis
Case Study: McDonald's

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze customer sentiment from online reviews and uncover actionable insights that can improve service quality in fast food chains. Using a real-world dataset of McDonald's customer reviews, we built sentiment classification models to detect common service pain points and provide data-driven recommendations for customer satisfaction.

🎯 Objectives
Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify McDonald’s reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.

Identify recurring service issues and city-level trends.

Recommend improvements tailored to customer preferences and expectations.

Demonstrate the value of text analytics in customer experience management.

📁 Dataset
Source: data.world - McDonald's Reviews Dataset

Content: Text reviews, city names, violated regulations, and confidence scores.

Volume: 1000+ textual reviews from multiple U.S. cities, collected in Feb 2015.

📊 Key Insights
Positive Sentiment Dominates, but negative reviews highlight persistent service issues.

Top Complaint Themes:

Long wait times

Poor food quality

Incorrect orders

Unprofessional staff behavior

Most Affected Cities:

Positive: Las Vegas

Negative: Chicago, Los Angeles, New York

🧠 Machine Learning Models
We implemented and compared four classification algorithms on the preprocessed text data using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer features.

Model	Accuracy
✅ Random Forest	74.10%
Logistic Regression	69.84%
Support Vector Machine	69.18%
Decision Tree	64.59%

🔍 Random Forest performed best, making it suitable for deployment in real-time review monitoring systems.

📈 Visualizations
Bar Charts – Sentiment distribution across cities

Word Clouds – Frequent negative and positive terms

Frequency Tables – Highlighting the most common complaint terms like wait, order, food, service
